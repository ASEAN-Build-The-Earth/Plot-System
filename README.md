### üóÇÔ∏è Project Status

This repository is now archived. The following custom features and modifications were introduced in this fork:

- Custom [ASEAN LIB](https://github.com/ASEAN-Build-The-Earth/Alps-Lib-asean) library for hologram and NPC utilities, based on [AlpsBTE/Alps-Lib](https://github.com/AlpsBTE/Alps-Lib)
- Integration with [DecentHologram](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/decentholograms-1-8-1-21-5-papi-support-no-dependencies.96927/), offering improved stability over [HolographicDisplays](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/holographic-displays)
- Plot coordinate shifting behavior (now included in a newer version of the Plot-System)
- Custom holograms including Country Boards, Welcome Messages, and Leaderboards

These changes have significantly diverged from the main branch. As a result, this version is now **unmaintained**. However, any useful features may still be manually cherry-picked and merged into the main branch if needed.
