### Notifications
New inactivity notification can be set in the plugin's config file

<table><tbody><tr><td><sub>

```yml
# How many days of inactivity it will take before a claimed plot is automatically abandoned
inactivity-interval: 14

# How long left until the plot gets abandon due to inactivity and the system will start pinging owner on discord
# Be careful, if set >= inactivity-interval will ping the owner every day after plot is created

## üåé Coordinates Options for Bedrock Support

New configurable coordinate features to customize the terra server with plot-system

### üìå **plot-shifting** 

> [!TIP]
> This feature aims to solve plot coordinates issue being too large for Bedrock client to handle.
>
> Enabling this will make supporting bedrock client with Geyser/Floodgate possible.

Enables shifting of single-plot worlds so the plot is positioned at (0, 0).

Opt-in by setting required-version to `3` and set enabled to `true` to use this feature.

    enabled: true
    required-version: 3
